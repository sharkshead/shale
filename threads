shale thread library

  - new threads
    - pass in a code fragment
    - need to communicate from the creating thread to the created thread
      - one int or namespace variable on the stack
    - leaves a thread id on the stack of the calling thread
  - joining threads
  - mutexes
    - use namespace variables
  - semaphores
    - use namespace variables
  - separate stack per thread
  - separate variable stack per thread
  - thread-safe BTree
    - what locking style to use
    - functions to lock and unlock the BTree from shale script
  - function to return how many independent threads are possible
    - is this possible ?


  {n} {cf} new thread::()

  {tid} join thread::()

  {nsv} mutex thread::()      // create a mutex

  {nsv} lock thread::()

  {nsv} unlock thread::()

  {nsv} semaphore thread::()  // create a semaphore

  {nsv} wait thread::()

  {nsv} post thread::()

  lockNamespaces thread::()

  unlockNamespaces thread::()

// The way in which you get command line arguments into you shale script
// is with replacements. A replacement on the command line looks like an assignment:
//  abc=xyz
// Anywhere in your script where the name abc appears will be replaced by xyz.
// You can have any number of replaceents on the command line.

// The "initialised" or "initialized" operators will check if a replacement has or has not
// been included on the command line. Here's an example

val var
val
  n initialised {
    n
  } {
    file arg:: shale:: "The default value of n is 10. You can change this with a replacement, eg: %s n=5\n" printf
    10
  } if
=

val "Value given is %d\n" printf

stack

// This prints the contents of the stack, top-of-stack
// first through to the end, and does not change anything.
// At the moment it can't print code fragments, but it can
// print names, numbers, and strings.

"btree:" println
btree

// All namespace variables are stored in a BTree (as opposed
// to simple variables that have a separate variable stack).
// The btree operator prints each namespace variable along
// with its valus. You'll notice that the internal name of
// each namespace variable resembles a Unix pathname, so a
// name such as
//
//  i ns::
//
// is stored in the BTree as /i/ns.

"debug:" println
debug

// This is really useful for diagnosing shale memory leaks.
// It may not be that useful for diagnosing script problems, but if
// you find that your code causes the numbers reported by debug
// to rise endlessly, then you should let me know.

// In most every language today the logical AND and OR operators
// are conditional, meaning that the second clause of the AND or OR
// is only evaluated if needed. In an RPN language like shale,
// where you must push all the values on the stack that each
// operator needs before calling the operator, you would think you
// can't have a conditional AND or OR.
//
// Not so.
//
// For brevity I'll use the and (&&) operator here, but this works
// for or (||) as well.
//
// To effect a conditional AND, push the first condition on the stack
// as usual, then push a code fragment on the stack which, when executed,
// will push your second condition on the stack.
//
// For example, something like this
//
//  cond1 cond2 and ...
//
// would turn into
//
//  cond1 { cond2 } and ...
//
// Both AND and OR will only execute the code fragment if the value
// of the first condition does not already decide the value of the overall
// AND or OR value.
//
// Conditional AND and OR can have profound functionality and performance
// impacts on your code,

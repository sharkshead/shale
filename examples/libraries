// shale libraries are loaded with the "library" operator.
// Each library will add functions you may call,
// or variables you may reference.
//
// At the time of writing, there are these libraries are avilable
//
//  array
//  file
//  maths
//  primes
//  time
//
// To load a library, use the library operator

array library
file library
maths library
primes library
time library

// Each library stores all their functions and variables under
// a namespace of their name. So, for example, the maths
// library uses the maths:: namespace.
//
// Every library provides a help function, always accessible
// from within the library's namespace.

help maths::()

// Here's an example of using the maths and time library functions
// I've placed each element on separate lines for clarity.

2 sqrt maths::()
0 time time::()
0 date time::()
"%s %s âˆš2 = %0.15f\n" printf

// Check out each library's help function before use. Running shale
// interactively is great for this - run shale with no arguments
// and enter, for example
//
//  file library
//  help file::()

// shale libraries are loaded with the "library" operator.
// Each library will add functions you may call,
// or variables you may reference.
//
// At the time of writing, there are three libraries avilable
//
//  array
//  file
//  maths
//
// To load a library, user the library operator

array library
file library
maths library

// Each library stores all they functions and variables under
// a namespae of their name. So, for example, the maths
// library uses the maths:: namespace.
//
// Every library provides a help function, always accessible
// from within the library's namespace.

help maths::()

// Here's an example of using one of the maths library's functions

2 sqrt maths::() "âˆš2 = %0.15f\n" printf

// Check out each librar's help function before use. Running shale
// interactively is great for this - run shale with no arguments
// and enter
//
//  file library
//  help file::()
